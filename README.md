# TIC-TAC-TOE-REACT-JS
It's an upgrade from the React tutorial app. Better controls and looks!

The first of the tic-tac-toe-verse, a collection of Tic-tac-toe games built on different tecnologies. 

This one is made with React (Javascript), SASS pre-compiled to CSS and deployed with gh-pages.

That's all. Also, you look great today! :)
